Exception External Module
-------------------------

DSP currently depends on DelphixFatalException and DelphixInterruptedException, which extend RuntimeException in a way
that is specific to the Delphix management service. Since DSP will eventually be open-sourced and used outside Delphix,
we ought to eliminate this dependency and employ standard Java exceptions. However, due to the amount of time this
refactoring would take, we've opted to temporarily move these exception classes (and related helper methods) into an
external module. Once DSP's dependency on Delphix-specific exceptions has been eliminated, these classes should be moved
back to appliance/server/core and this module should be eliminated.
